# Addressy

## Overview

__Addressy__ is a small Rails 5 app utilizing React to create a simple address book.

Yes, __Addressy__ is pretty terrible name. I chose it because that's was available on Heroku and it sounds much better than __desolate-reef-22841__

Speaking of Heroku, you can demo this app [here](http://addressy.herokuapp.com/)
