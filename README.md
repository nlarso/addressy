# Addressy

## Overview

__Addressy__ is a small Rails 5 app utilizing React to create a simple address book.

Yes, __Addressy__ is pretty terrible name. I chose it because it was available on Heroku and sounds much better than something like __desolate-reef-22841__

Speaking of Heroku, you can demo this app [here](http://addressy.herokuapp.com/)
